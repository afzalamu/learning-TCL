# 📘 TCL Chapter 1 Notes

A concise guide to **TCL (Tool Command Language)**, based on introductory concepts and commands. This guide helps beginners understand how TCL scripts work, how to declare and manipulate variables, and how substitution works in the interpreter.

---

## 🔰 Introduction to TCL

- **TCL** (Tool Command Language) is:
  - A scripting language.
  - A string-based command language.
  - An interpreted language.
- In TCL, **everything is a string**.
- Widely used in:
  - EDA tools.
  - Test automation.
  - System scripting.
- Interpreted: No compilation, runs line-by-line.
- Cross-platform: Same code can run on any system with a Tcl interpreter.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

- Download and install TclKit or any Tcl interpreter.
- Check installed version:
  ```tcl
  info tclversion
````

Example:

```tcl
% info tclversion
8.6
```

## 🔡 Basic Syntax and Commands

### 🔹 General Syntax

* A Tcl script is made of **words**, separated by space or tab.
* First word: command name.
* Rest: arguments.
* Commands are case-sensitive and can be separated by:

  * Newlines
  * Semicolons (`;`)
* Example:

  ```tcl
  set fCode "Hello World"
  puts $fCode
  ```

---

### 🔸 Variables and Assignment

* Assign a value using `set`:

  ```tcl
  set var1 12
  set var2 34
  puts $var1$var2  ;# Outputs 1234
  ```
* No type declaration needed. Everything is a string.
* Avoid using `.` or `-` in variable names.
* If needed, use curly braces:

  ```tcl
  set var3.1 45
  puts ${var3.1}
  ```

---

### 🔸 Accessing Variable Values

* Use `$` to access values:

  ```tcl
  set var1 3
  set var2 $var1  ;# var2 is now 3
  ```

---

### 🔸 Multiple Commands in One Line

* Use `;` to write multiple commands in one line:

  ```tcl
  set var1 3; set var4 4
  ```

> ⚠️ This is valid but not recommended for clarity and debugging.

---

### 🔸 Unset Command

* Delete a variable and free memory:

  ```tcl
  unset var1
  ```
* Check if a variable exists:

  ```tcl
  info exists var4  ;# Returns 1 if exists, 0 otherwise
  ```

---

### 🔸 Incrementing Variables

* Increment using `incr`:

  ```tcl
  incr afzal       ;# Adds 1
  incr afzal 24    ;# Adds 24
  ```

## 🔄 Substitution and Parsing

### Types of Substitution:

| Type                   | Syntax      | Description                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Variable Substitution  | `$var`      | Replaced by value of the variable                 |
| Command Substitution   | `[command]` | Executes command and inserts its result           |
| Backslash Substitution | `\\`, `\n`  | Escapes special characters like newline, tab etc. |

#### Examples:

```tcl
set var2 [set var1 3]  ;# var2 gets 3
set var1 \$5           ;# var1 gets literal "$5"
set var3 \\n           ;# var3 gets literal "\n"
```

## 🧠 TCL Interpreter Execution Flow

1. **Parsing**: Splits command into words.
2. **Substitution**: Replaces variables, commands, and escape characters.
3. **Execution**: Executes command with its arguments.

---

## 📝 Key Points Recap

* TCL is simple, extensible, and embeddable.
* All values are strings.
* Use `set`, `unset`, `incr`, `info exists` for working with variables.
* Use `{}` for accessing variables with special characters like `.` or `-`.
