What is Tcl?
Tcl (Tool Command Language) is a scripting language, a string-based command language, and an interpreted language.

In Tcl, everything is a string. All data types can be treated as strings.

Tcl is widely used for automating tasks in software development, electronic design automation (EDA), and system administration.

Tcl is known for its flexibility and simplicity, making it accessible even for beginners.

Tcl is extensible (can be enhanced with libraries) and embeddable (used inside other applications, e.g., Vivado, ModelSim).

Tcl is interpreted: code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter, not compiled.

Basic Syntax
A Tcl script contains one or more words.

Words are separated by spaces or tabs.

The first word is the command name; the remaining words are parameters.

Commands are separated by semicolons or newlines.

Both commands and variables are case sensitive.

Example:

text
set fCode "Hello World"
puts $fCode
set Fcode "Afzal Malik"
puts $Fcode
Variables
Assign values using the set command:

text
set var1 12
set var2 34
puts $var1$var2   ;# Outputs 1234
Variables are always treated as strings.

Variable names should ideally contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.

Avoid using . and - in variable names. If necessary, access such variables using curly braces:

text
set var3.1 45
puts ${var3.1}
Underscores are recommended:

text
set var3_1 45
puts $var3_1
Accessing Variable Values
Use $ to access the value of a variable:

text
set var1 3
set var2 $var1   ;# var2 now holds 3
Assigning without $ just copies the variable name as a string:

text
set var2 var1    ;# var2 is the string "var1"
Multi-Command Lines
Multiple commands can be written on a single line, separated by semicolons:

text
set var1 3; set var4 4;
Only the last value is returned. For clarity, write one command per line.

Unsetting Variables
Use unset to delete a variable and free its memory:

text
unset var1
It is illegal to unset an undefined variable.

To check if a variable exists:

text
info exists var4   ;# Returns 1 if exists, 0 otherwise
Incrementing Variables
Use incr to increment a variable:

text
incr afzal         ;# Adds 1
incr afzal 24      ;# Adds 24
Substitution and Parsing
Variable substitution: $var is replaced by its value.

Command substitution: [command] executes the command and replaces the brackets with the result.

Backslash substitution: Special sequences like \n, \t are replaced with their special meanings.

text
set var2 [set var1 3]   ;# var2 gets 3
set var1 \$5            ;# var1 gets $5 (literal dollar sign)
set var3 \\n            ;# var3 gets \n (literal backslash n)
Grouping and Quoting
Curly braces {} group words into a single argument and prevent substitution until evaluated by the command.

Double quotes "" group words and allow substitution inside.

text
puts {Hello, World!}
puts "Value is $var1"
Tcl Interpreter Execution Model
Parsing: Command is split into words.

Substitution: Interpreter checks for variable ($), command ([]), or backslash substitutions.

Execution: Command is executed with given arguments.

Key Points and Best Practices
Tcl is minimalist: most features (including control structures) are implemented as commands, not language syntax.

Tcl's extensibility allows you to add new commands and programming paradigms via extensions.

Use interactive mode (REPL) to experiment and learn Tcl quickly.

Tcl is used as a "glue" language to assemble software components and automate tools.

For control structures (loops, conditionals), use commands like if, while, and for (covered in later chapters).

Tcl is widely used in EDA tools, test automation, rapid prototyping, and GUI scripting with Tk.

Example: Hello, World!
text
puts "Hello, World!"
Or, specifying the output stream:

text
puts stdout {Hello, World!}
