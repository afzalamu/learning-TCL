# 📘 TCL Chapter 1 Notes

This document serves as a beginner-friendly guide to **TCL (Tool Command Language)**, based on Chapter 1 and extended with practical insights and important concepts.

---

## 🔧 Getting Started

- **Install TclKit** to run standalone Tcl scripts.
- **Check your installed version**:
  ```tcl
  info tclversion
````

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 📌 Variable Declaration and Access

* Tcl variables are created during assignment:

  ```tcl
  set myVar "Hello, Tcl!"
  ```

* Access a variable using the `$` sign:

  ```tcl
  puts $myVar
  ```

* Check if a variable exists:

  ```tcl
  info exists myVar
  ```

* If a variable name contains special characters like `.` or `-`, use braces:

  ```tcl
  set {my-var} "value"
  ```

* Underscores `_` are safe to use in variable names.

---

### 🧵 String Handling and Appending

* Tcl treats everything as a string. No conversion needed from int → string.

* Appending strings:

  ```tcl
  set str "Hello"
  append str ", World!"
  puts $str ;# Output: Hello, World!
  ```

* Concatenation is straightforward and implicit.

---

### 🔁 Multiple Commands in One Line

* You can run multiple commands on the same line using `;`

  ```tcl
  set a 10; set b 20; puts "$a + $b"
  ```

  > ⚠️ Not recommended for clarity and debugging.

## 🔄 Substitution Types in TCL

| Type                   | Syntax      | Description                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Variable Substitution  | `$varName`  | Access value of variable          |
| Command Substitution   | `[command]` | Executes command, replaces result |
| Backslash Substitution | `\\`        | Escapes special characters        |

---

## 🧭 Syntax Notes

* Avoid using `.` or `-` in variable names unless enclosed in `{}`.
* Double quotes `"` are used differently compared to many other languages.
* Prefer `{}` for grouping expressions and preventing substitutions.

---

## 📚 Additional Notes

### 🔹 Comments

* Use `#` for single-line comments:

  ```tcl
  # This is a comment
  ```

### 🔹 Output/Printing

* Use `puts` for output:

  ```tcl
  puts "Hello, TCL"
  ```

### 🔹 Dynamic Typing

* Tcl is dynamically typed; values can change type at runtime.

### 🔹 Case Sensitivity

* Tcl is case-sensitive:

  ```tcl
  set Name "Afzal"
  set name "Malik"
  ```

### 🔹 Script Execution

* Save scripts with `.tcl` extension and run using:

  ```bash
  tclsh script.tcl
  ```
