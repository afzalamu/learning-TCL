### âœ… What's included:
- Your raw notes, cleaned and structured.
- Practical examples.
- Internet-based clarifications for `puts`, `set`, `info exists`, etc.
- Markdown-friendly for GitHub display.
- Readable as a standalone learning document.

Would you like me to help generate a matching `repo` folder structure or `contribution guide` as well?
